# Work Day Scheduler App

## **User Story**

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## **Features**
```
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
## **Development Process**

Using the supplied index.html and style.css to provide the initial framework, I worked gradually through jscript syntax to apply components of the app. 

I started with the date and time elements at the top of the page before going to add the hours for the day from 9AM to 5PM before making the save button and testing its functionality.

Then I worked to create the dynamism that would change the colours of the day depending on the time of day, so the past is grey, the present is red, and the future is green.

## **Installation & Usage Instructions**

## **Directions for Future Development**

It would be good to add a page functionality to store the information for multiple days, as well as clear functionality to easily remove saved data.
